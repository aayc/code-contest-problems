Note
In the first sample, the cheapest way to obtain palindromic colors is to buy a black suit for the third from left dancer and a white suit for the rightmost dancer.
In the second sample, the leftmost dancer's suit already differs from the rightmost dancer's suit so there is no way to obtain the desired coloring.
In the third sample, all suits are already bought and their colors form a palindrome.
